# Risk Tiering Shared Rulebook

This document defines canonical risk-tiering semantics used by multiple profiles/addons.
It is designed as an advisory addon rulebook.

Priority order on conflict:
`master.md` > `rules.md` (Core) > profile rulebook > this shared advisory rulebook.

## Principal Hardening v2.1 - Standard Risk Tiering (Binding when loaded)

### RTN-1 Canonical tiers (binding)

All addon/template assessments MUST use this canonical tier syntax:

- `TIER-LOW`: local/internal changes with low blast radius and no external contract or persistence risk.
- `TIER-MEDIUM`: behavior changes with user-facing, API-facing, or multi-module impact.
- `TIER-HIGH`: contract, persistence/migration, messaging/async, security, or rollback-sensitive changes.

If uncertain, choose the higher tier.

### RTN-2 Tier evidence minimums (binding)

- `TIER-LOW`: build/lint (if present) + targeted changed-scope tests.
- `TIER-MEDIUM`: `TIER-LOW` evidence + at least one negative-path assertion for changed behavior.
- `TIER-HIGH`: `TIER-MEDIUM` evidence + one deterministic resilience/rollback-oriented proof
  (retry/idempotency/recovery/concurrency as applicable).

### RTN-3 Tier-based gate decisions (binding)

- A gate result cannot be `pass` when mandatory tier evidence is missing.
- For advisory addons, missing tier evidence remains non-blocking but MUST emit WARN + recovery and result `partial` or `fail`.
- For required addons/templates, missing `TIER-HIGH` evidence may block code-phase per master/core/profile policy.

### RTN-4 Required SESSION_STATE shape (binding)

```yaml
SESSION_STATE:
  RiskTiering:
    ActiveTier: TIER-LOW | TIER-MEDIUM | TIER-HIGH
    Rationale: "short evidence-based reason"
    MandatoryEvidence:
      - EV-001
      - EV-002
    MissingEvidence: []
```

### RTN-5 Unresolved tier handling (binding)

If tier cannot be determined from available evidence, set status code `WARN-RISK-TIER-UNRESOLVED`,
provide a conservative default (`TIER-HIGH`), and include recovery steps to refine classification.
