# Scorecard Calibration Shared Rulebook

This document defines shared scorecard calibration for cross-addon comparability.
It is designed as an advisory addon rulebook.

Priority order on conflict:

## Principal Hardening v2.1.1 - Scorecard Calibration (Binding)

### CAL-1 Standard criterion weights by tier (binding)

For principal scorecards in addon/template rulebooks, criteria weights MUST use this standard model:

- `TIER-LOW`: each active criterion weight = `2`
- `TIER-MEDIUM`: each active criterion weight = `3`
- `TIER-HIGH`: each active criterion weight = `5`

No custom weights are allowed unless explicitly documented as repo-specific exception with rationale and risk note.

### CAL-2 Critical-flag normalization (binding)

The following criteria classes MUST be marked `critical: true` when applicable:

- contract/integration correctness
- determinism and anti-flakiness
- rollback/recovery safety
- security semantics and authorization behavior

Non-critical criteria may exist, but cannot compensate for a failed critical criterion.

### CAL-3 Tier score thresholds (binding)

A principal-grade gate result may be `pass` only if all conditions are true:

- all applicable critical criteria are `pass`
- total score ratio meets threshold:
  - `TIER-LOW`: >= `0.80`
  - `TIER-MEDIUM`: >= `0.85`
  - `TIER-HIGH`: >= `0.90`

If threshold is missed, result MUST be `partial` or `fail` with recovery actions.

### CAL-4 Cross-addon comparability (binding)

When multiple addons are active in one ticket, scorecards MUST be directly comparable by using:

- canonical tier labels (`TIER-LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH`)
- standardized weight model from CAL-1
- identical pass thresholds from CAL-3

### CAL-5 Required SESSION_STATE calibration evidence (binding)

```yaml
SESSION_STATE:
  GateScorecards:
    principal_excellence:
      ActiveTier: TIER-LOW | TIER-MEDIUM | TIER-HIGH
      Score: 0
      MaxScore: 0
      ScoreRatio: 0.00
      Threshold: 0.80 | 0.85 | 0.90
      CalibrationVersion: v2.1.1
```

### CAL-6 Calibration warning code (binding)

If scorecard data is incomplete or non-comparable, emit `WARN-SCORECARD-CALIBRATION-INCOMPLETE`
and block principal-grade declaration (`not-verified`).
