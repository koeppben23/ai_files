This repo uses Governance Kernel rules

Default to ARCHITECT plan-only until explicit ‘Implement now’
No claim without evidence
If evidence missing → BLOCKED + recovery
AGENTS.md is a non-normative mirror of master.md; conflicts resolve to master.md

Bootstrap Evidence: OpenCodeBinding (installer-owned binding evidence) OR AGENTS.md Presence

AGENTS.md Frontend-Surface; CI will reference kernel (master.md) as Truth

AGENTS.md contains no host-binding tokens

Kernel wins on conflict. AGENTS.md is only an alternative frontend surface.
