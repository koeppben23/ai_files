# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This file stores **explicit architecture decisions** made during work with this governance system.

Goals:
- Reduce cognitive load (decisions don’t live only in chat history)
- Preserve architectural intent over time
- Enable conflict detection (new proposals vs. existing decisions)

Rules of thumb:
- Record only **non-trivial** decisions (things that affect architecture, contracts, boundaries, persistence, deployment, security posture, or major dependencies).
- Keep entries short, structured, and evidence-linked when possible.
